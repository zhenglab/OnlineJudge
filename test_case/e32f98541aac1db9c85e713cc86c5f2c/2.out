I don't remember when it first started annoying me her hands pushing my hair
that way. But it did annoy me, for they felt work-worn and rough against my
young skin. Finally, one night, I shouted out at her, "Don't do that anymore
your hands are too rough!" She didn't say anything in reply. But never again
did my mother close out my day with that familiar expression of her love.
